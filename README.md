# Elijah & Ali's After Work Shenanigans

Welcome to Elijah and Ali's repository. We’re not sure what brought you here, but we're glad you found us. Elijah and I meet up a few times a week to explore new tools and technology. This repository documents our journey as two minds try to figure out stuff with no work pressure.

While we may sound like a typical geek duo, don’t be fooled. We also spend time outdoors and enjoy coffee.

Will keep y'all posted on our progress!
